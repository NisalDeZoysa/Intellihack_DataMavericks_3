      "What are different types of categories in the FashionMNIST dataset? \n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "We use the front look thumbnail images of 70,000 unique products to build Fashion-MNIST. Those products come from different gender groups: men, women, kids and neutral. In particular, white-color products are not included in the dataset as they have low contrast to the background. The thumbnails (51\\times 73) are then fed into the following conversion pipeline, which is visualized in Figure 1.\n",

      "The FashionMNIST dataset is a subset of the MNIST dataset, which originally contains handwritten digits images, but here it focuses on small images (28x2 Fuk) of common clothing items. Since the FashionMNIST dataset does not describe specific categories within clothing items, we need to look at common types of clothing items to categorize the images. A common categorization for clothing items includes categories such as Tops, Bottoms (e.g., pants, shorts, skirts), Shoes, and Accessories (e.g., bags, hats, belts). \n",

      "We show that high quality videos can be generated using essentially the standard formulation of the Gaussian diffusion model (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015), with little modification other than straightforward architectural changes to accommodate video data within the memory constraints of deep learning accelerators. We train models that generate a fixed number of video frames using a 3D U-Net diffusion model architecture, and we enable generating longer videos by applying this model autoregressively using a new method for conditional generation. We additionally show the benefits of joint training on video and image modeling objectives. We test our methods on video prediction and unconditional video generation, where we achieve state-of-the-art sample quality scores, and we also show promising first results on text-conditioned video generation.\n",

      "While most NAS techniques are not compared with a random search method, the authors (Li and Talwalkar, 2019) reported that a random search method is highly competitive. So we conducted an experiment to compare the proposed NAS technique with two random search methods, exploring the same search space defined by the supernet structure of ours-M.First, we designed a simple random search method that has the similar time complexity of the proposed technique. In this method, we randomly generate 15 models having a similar latency with ours-M, from the same search space. Then we train each of them for 1 epoch with cosine learning rate decay. After evaluating each of them, we choose the architecture with the topmost top-1 accuracy and fully train it. In the second method, called random selection, we randomly generate 20 models having a similar latency with ours-M and train them fully and take the architecture with the highest top-1 accuracy. Since the random selection method performs search and training simultaneously, it is slower than the proposed technique by the number of randomly generated models.\n",

      "Answer:\n",
      "Another related area of research concerns deep learning architectures on graph-structured data.The GNN was first proposed in Gori et al. (2005); Scarselli et al. (2009), as a trainable recurrent message-passingwhose fixed points could be adjusted discriminatively.Subsequent works Li et al. (2015); Sukhbaatar et al. (2016) have relaxed the model by untying the recurrent layer weights and proposed several nonlinear updates through gating mechanisms.Graph neural networks are in fact natural generalizations of convolutional networks to non-Euclidean graphs. Bruna et al. (2013); Henaff et al. (2015) proposed to learn smooth spectral multipliers of the graph Laplacian, albeit with high computational cost, and Defferrard et al. (2016); Kipf & Welling (2016) resolved the computational bottleneck by learning polynomials of the graph Laplacian, thus avoiding the computation of eigenvectors and completing the connection with GNNs. In particular, Kipf & Welling (2016)was the first to propose the use of GNNs on semi-supervised classification problems.We refer the reader to Bronstein et al. (2017) for an exhaustive literature review on the topic.GNNs and the analogous Neural Message Passing Models are finding application in many different domains. Battaglia et al. (2016); Chang et al. (2016) develop graph interaction networks that learn pairwise particle interactions and apply them to discrete particle physical dynamics. Duvenaud et al. (2015); Kearnes et al. (2016) study molecular fingerprints using variants of the GNN architecture, and Gilmer et al. (2017) further develop the model by combining it with set representations Vinyals et al.

      "In music theory, a \"chord\" typically refers to a simultaneous combination of at least three different musical notes, while a \"beat\" in a musical piece generally represents a single regular pulsation or acoustic click at the repetition rate of a musical work. Although there are occasional instances where multiple notes or pitches are played simultaneously, the term \"chord\" specifically denotes a combination of notes within a musical component. Beats, on the other hand, are fundamental to rhythm and meter, signifying the beat patterns that help create the feel of a piece, like in the case of a 4/4 time signature where there are four beats per measure.

However, if the second rule was ‘‘Rough, nice people are not red.’’, then the sign of the goal would disagree with the sign of the consequent and so we would conclude that the goal is disproved.

(2017), and was later adopted by PLMs such as SpanBERT Joshi et al. (2020).Zhang et al. (2017) claim that this technique prevents the RE model from over-fitting specific entity names, leading to more generalizable inference.•Entity marker Zhang et al. (2019); Baldini Soares et al. (2019). This technique introduces special tokens pairs [E1], [/E1] and [E2], [/E2] to enclose the subject and object entities, therefore modifying the input text to the format of “[E1] subj [/E1] … [E2] obj [/E2]”333subj and obj are respectively the original token spans of subject and object entities..•Entity marker (punct) Wang et al. (2020); Zhou et al. (2021). This technique is a variant of the previous technique that encloses entity spans using punctuation.It modifies the input text to “@ subj @ … # obj #”. The main difference from the previous technique is that this one does not introduce new special tokens into the model’s reserved vocabulary.•Typed entity marker Zhong and Chen (2021). This technique further incorporates the NER types into entity markers.It introduces new special tokens \\langleS:TYPE\\rangle, \\langle/S:TYPE\\rangle, \\langleO:TYPE\\rangle, \\langle/O:TYPE\\rangle, where TYPE is the corresponding NER type given by a named entity tagger. The input text is accordingly modified to “\\langleS:TYPE\\rangle subj \\langle/S:TYPE\\rangle … \\langleO:TYPE\\rangle obj \\langle/O:TYPE\\rangle”.•Typed entity marker (punct). We propose a variant of the typed entity marker technique that marks the entity span and entity types without introducing new special tokens.This is to enclose the subject and object entities with “@” and “#”, respectively.We also represent the subject and object entity types using their label text, which is prepended to the entity spans and is enclosed by “*” for subjects or “\\wedge” for objects.The modified text is “@ * subj-type * subj @ … # \\wedge obj-type \\wedge obj # ”, where subj-type and obj-type is the label text of NER types.\n",

To deal with these challenges, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is a parameterized generalization of ensembling techniques, which has been adapted for MTL with gating network trained to optimize each task (Ma et al., 2018). However, simple linear gating networks are too shallow and thus may destruct task knowledge for commonsense reasoning.\n",

      "They claim that in brain tumours, there is a hierarchical layout of sub-components. Is this True ? Any related experiments that proved it ? \n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "The quantitative analysis of lesions requires accurate lesion segmentation in multi-modal, three-dimensional images which is a challenging task for a number of reasons. The heterogeneous appearance of lesions including the large variability in location, size, shape and frequency make it difficult to devise effective segmentation rules.It is thus highly non-trivial to delineate contusions, edema and haemorrhages in TBI (Irimia et al. (2012)), or sub-components of brain tumors such as proliferating cells and necrotic core (Menze et al. (2015)). The arguably most accurate segmentation results can be obtained through manual delineation by a human expert which is tedious, expensive, time-consuming, impractical in larger studies, and introduces inter-observer variability. Additionally, for deciding whether a particular region is part of a lesion multiple image sequences with varying contrasts need to be considered, and the level of expert knowledge and experience are important factors that impact segmentation accuracy. Hence, in clinical routine often only qualitative, visual inspection, or at best crude measures like approximate lesion volume and number of lesions are used (Yuh et al. (2012); Wen et al. (2010)). In order to capture and better understand the complexity of brain pathologies it is important to conduct large studies with many subjects to gain the statistical power for drawing conclusions across a whole patient population. The development of accurate, automatic segmentation algorithms has therefore become a major research focus in medical image computing with the potential to offer objective, reproducible, and scalable approaches to quantitative assessment of brain lesions.\n",

However, more research is required to confirm the presence of such a hierarchy in all types of brain tumours. Additionally, the term \"hierarchical layout\" might need to be reevaluated, as it is not a standard term in tumour biology.

(2021) proposes combining the MI between the data and class prediction as a negative loss term with an augmentation invariance consistency loss.Both IIC and TWIST use the MI as a loss function and directly optimize their model parameters with gradient descent of the loss.However, the direct optimization of MI terms by updating model parameters often leads to a sub-optimal solution Feng et al.

      "Ofﬂine Reinforcement Learning. There have been extensive studies on ofﬂine RL (Fujimoto et al., 2019; Levine et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). Most of prior works are built on the off-policy actor-critic framework, and they focus on the overestimation issue by taking the OOD actions (Kumar et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2020; Fujimoto et al., 2019; Jaques et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2020). However, a naive application of these ofﬂine RL methods suffer from the issue of diverging from human language in the task-oriented dialogues (Lewis et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2019; Jang et al., 2020). On the other hand, there are a number of recent works on weighted behavior cloning, where a policy is trained by a variant of supervised learning loss (Wang et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2019; Siegel et al., 2020). The weighted behavior cloning approaches ﬁlter out bad actions, then perform behavior cloning on high-quality data. However, in the task-oriented dialogues, simply dropping the unsuccessful dialogues from the corpus is undesirable, since they may contain some task-speciﬁc information that is useful to properly respond to user requests. Our GPT-Critic aims to revise unsuccessful dialogues into successful ones, which is in contrast to the weighted behavior cloning on the ﬁxed training dataset, where the action choice is restricted to the support in the dataset (Wang et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2019; Siegel et al., 2020). More recently, Chen et al. (2021) introduce Decision Transformer, a Transformer-based architecture that casts the problem of RL as conditional sequence modeling. These ofﬂine RL methods based on behavior cloning are directly applied to the task-oriented dialogues without aforementioned issue, but their results are similar to that of behavior cloning in the task-oriented dialogues.\n",

First, we evaluate the performances of GPT-Critic on the MultiWOZ 2.0 (Budzianowski et al., 2018) as dataset-based automatic evaluation, compared with baseline methods including ofﬂine RL algorithms. Second, for more realistic evaluation, we conduct a simulator-based evaluation on the ConvLab framework (Zhu et al., 2020). Third, we also conduct the human eval- uation to evaluate the quality of generated responses. Finally, we give a qualitative analysis of our method using generated dialogue examples on the training dataset of MultiWOZ 2.0, which shows how GPT-Critic improves the performance through the behavior cloning of self-generated dialogues.

We visualize the activations of DeepMedic’s FMs when processing a subject from our TBI database. Many appearing patterns are difficult to interpret, especially in deeper layers. In Fig. 14 we provide some examples that have an intuitive explanation. One of the most interesting findings is that the network learns to identify the ventricles, CSF, white and gray matter. This reveals that differentiation of tissue type is beneficial for lesion segmentation. This is in line with findings in the literature, where segmentation performance of traditional classifiers was significantly improved by incorporation of tissue priors (Van Leemput et al.

      "Deeper networks have greater discriminative power due to the additional non-linearities and better quality of local optima (Choromanska et al. (2015)). However, convolutions with 3D kernels are computationally expensive in comparison to the 2D variants, which hampers the addition of more layers. Additionally, 3D architectures have a larger number of trainable parameters, with each layer adding C_{l}C_{l-1}\\prod_{i=\\{x,y,z\\}}{\\bm{\\kappa}_{l}^{(i)}} weights to the model. C_{l} is the number of FMs in layer l and \\bm{\\kappa}_{l}^{\\{x,y,z\\}} the size of its kernel in the respective spatial dimension. Overall this makes the network increasingly prone to over-fitting.\n",

      "We use the Imagen saharia2022photorealistic  text-guided synthesis model as a backbone. Since the composition and geometry are mostly determined at the 64\\times 64 resolution, we only adapt the text-to-image diffusion model, using the super-resolution process as is.Recall that each diffusion step t consists of predicting the noise \\epsilon from a noisy image z_{t} and text embedding \\psi(\\mathcal{P}) using a U-shaped network ronneberger2015u . At the final step, this process yields the generated image \\mathcal{I}=z_{0}.Most importantly, the interaction between the two modalities occurs during the noise prediction, where the embeddings of the visual and textual features are fused using Cross-attention layers that produce spatial attention maps for each textual token.\n",

      "Answer:\n",
      "To consider different types of reasoning, this paper extends ideas from the aforementioned zero-shot learning to the multi-source case such that it benefits from different types of commonsense knowledge on individual KGs. For example, ATOMIC (Sap et al., 2019a) focuses on social commonsense while ConceptNet (Speer et al., 2017) contains conceptual knowledge. A practical approach is multi-task learning (MTL; Caruana, 1997; Liu et al., 2019a), which learns a shared encoder for different synthetic QA datasets from multiple KGs. Despite its effectiveness, MTL scheme suffers from interference among different KGs, which results in forgetting previously learned knowledge when trained on new KG which has different kinds of knowledge (Pilault et al., 2021; Pfeiffer et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021a; Wu et al., 2020).\n",

      "Passage Re-ranking is a crucial stage in modern information retrieval systems, which aims to reorder a small set of candidate passages to be presented to users. To put the most relevant passages on top of a ranking list, a re-ranker is usually designed with powerful capacity in modeling semantic relevance, which attracted a wealth of research studies in the past decade (Guo et al., 2020). Recently,large-scale pre-trained language models (PLMs), e.g. BERT (Devlinet al., 2018), ERNIE (Sun et al., 2019) and RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), have dominated many natural language processing tasks, and have also achieved remarkable success on passage re-ranking.For example, PLM based re-rankers (MacAvaney et al., 2019; Liet al., 2020; Dong and Niu, 2021; Donget al., 2022) have achieved state-of-the-art performance, which takes the concatenation of query-passage pair as input, and applies multi-layer full-attention to model their semantic relevance. Their superiority can be attributed to the expressive transformer structure and the pretrain-then-finetune paradigm, which allow the model to learn useful implicit knowledge (i.e., semantic relevance in the latent space) from massive textual corpus (Fan et al., 2021).\n",

      "How did the authors ensure to keep the factor wl equal to one divided by the number of active layers with a non-zero loss-weight wl? \n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "On top of the CNN responses in each layer of the network we built a style representation that computes the correlations between the different filter responses, where the expectation is taken over the spatial extend of the input image. These feature correlations are given by the Gram matrix Gl ∈ RNl×Nl , where Gl ij is the inner product between the vectorised feature map and j in layer l: Gl ij = ∑ k F l ikF l jk. (3) To generate a texture that matches the style of a given image (Fig 1, style reconstructions), we use gradient descent from a white noise image to find another image that matches the style representation of the original image. This is done by minimising the mean-squared distance between the entries of the Gram matrix from the original image and the Gram matrix of the image to be generated. So let ~a and ~x be the original image and the image that is generated and Al and Gl their respective style representations in layer l. The contribution of that layer to the total loss is then El = 1 4N 2 l M 2 l ∑ i,j (Gl ij − Al ij )2 (4) and the total loss is Lstyle(~a, ~x) = L∑ l=0 wlEl (5) where wl are weighting factors of the contribution of each layer to the total loss (see below for specific values of wl in our results). The derivative of El with respect to the activations in layer l can be computed analytically: ∂El ∂F l ij = { 1 N 2 l M 2 l ((F l)T (Gl − Al)) ji if F l ij > 0 0 if F l ij < 0 . (6) The gradients of El with respect to the activations in lower layers of the network can be readily computed using standard error back-propagation. The five style reconstructions in Fig 1 were generated by matching the style representations on layer ‘conv1 1’ (a), ‘conv1 1’ and ‘conv2 1’ (b), ‘conv1 1’, ‘conv2 1’ and ‘conv3 1’ (c), ‘conv1 1’, ‘conv2 1’, ‘conv3 1’ and ‘conv4 1’ (d), ‘conv1 1’, ‘conv2 1’, ‘conv3 1’, ‘conv4 1’ and ‘conv5 1’ (e).\n",

Then, the inner core of \\mathbf{w}_{5,6} can be considered as \\mathbf{w}_{3,6}, a DWConv kernel of MBConv{}_{3,6}.A superkernel containing these two kernel size options can be expressed as Figure 4:(1)\\mathbf{w}_{*,6}=\\mathbf{w}_{3,6}+\\mathbbm{1}(\\rm{use\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ kernel\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ size\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ 5})\\cdot\\mathbf{w}_{5\\backslash 3,6}where \\mathbf{w}_{5\\backslash 3,e} means the outer part, \\mathbf{w}_{5,e}-\\mathbf{w}_{3,e}.Next, they formulate conditions to determine the kernel size. They define a certain threshold value t and compare the norm of the kernel weights with the threshold. If the norm of a subset weight is larger than the threshold, it remains in the supernet.

In addition, we also used the DrawBench prompts from Imagen (Saharia et al., 2022) for human evaluation.We evaluate video quality and text-video faithfulness. For video quality, we show two videos in random order and ask annotators which one is of higher quality. For faithfulness, we additionally show the text and ask annotators which video has a better correspondence with the text (we suggest them to ignore quality issues). In addition, we also conducted human evaluation to compare video motion realism of our interpolation model and FILM (Reda et al., 2022).For each comparison, we use the majority vote from 5 different annotators as the final result.\n",

Speciﬁcally, human workers on AMT were asked to read the context and generated response by interactive simulation via ConvLab, then score the following two evaluation metrics on a Likert scale (1-5): 1) Appropriateness : evaluates whether the generated responses are appropriate for the given context, 2) Fluency : evaluates whether the gen- erated responses are comprehensible and human-like. We compare the performance of GPT-Critic with same baselines on ConvLab evaluation. Figure 3 summarizes the overall results of human eval- uation, where 60 workers evaluate the quality of 30 randomly selected dialogues for each algorithm. The results show that GPT-Critic signiﬁcantly outperforms baseline algorithms in appropriateness which is related to task accomplishment.

      "Answer:\n",
      "To contribute to the efficient Transformers lineage, we propose SBM-Transformer, capable of adjusting its attention sparsity data-adaptively based without fully computing the attention score matrix (Figure 1). Leveraging a mixed-membership Stochastic Block Model (SBM) [2], each attention head samples a bipartite graph connecting queries to keys. Then, the adjacency of the sampled graph is used as an attention mask so that only attention scores corresponding to sampled edges are computed.The overall computational cost is linear in the number of edges, which can range from linear to quadratic in sequence length depending on the data and task under concern. Each attention head is equipped with its own underlying SBM, enabling the model to diversify the attention sparsity across heads and layers. By incorporating a straight-through estimator [4] in the discrete graph-sampling step, SBM-Transformer enjoys end-to-end differentiability and can find the proper attention sparsity based solely upon minimizing the predictive loss. The model can also easily be further regularized by penalizing the number of sampled edges, which results in a lighter model using less computational resources during inference. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first Transformer architecture that can data-adaptively choose between linear to full attention with respective computational costs.

      "Answer:\n",
      "Training a task-oriented dialogue agent can be naturally formulated as ofﬂine rein- forcement learning (RL) problem, where the agent aims to learn a conversational strategy to achieve user goals, only from a dialogue corpus. It is very challenging in terms of RL since the natural language action space is astronomical, while feasi- ble (syntactically and semantically correct) actions are very sparse. Thus, standard RL methods easily fail and generate responses diverging from human language, even when ﬁne-tuning a powerful pre-trained language model. In this paper, we introduce GPT-Critic, an ofﬂine RL method for task-oriented dialogue. GPT-Critic is built upon GPT-2, ﬁne-tuning the language model through behavior cloning of the critic-guided self-generated sentences. GPT-Critic is essentially free from the issue of diverging from human language since it learns from the sentences sam- pled from the pre-trained language model. In the experiments, we demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art in the task-oriented dialogue benchmarks including MultiWOZ 2.0 and ConvLab.\n",

      "1. **RL Domain:**\n",
      "   Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a subfield of machine learning where agents learn to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. The core focus of RL is on the exploration-exploitation trade-off: the agent must explore different actions to learn the optimal policy, and at the same time, exploit the learned actions to maximize rewards. Common challenges in RL include learning complex goal-directed behavior, balancing between exploration and exploitation, dealing with high-dimensional state and action spaces, and maintaining the integrity of the policy learning in dynamic, uncertain environments.\n",

      "In this study, CNN is utilized for classification because it takes image’s raw pixel data, trains a model, and extracts the features automatically for better detection. We used autokeras to find the best model for this problem. After trying 25 different combinations, we selected 3 hidden layers with 1 input and 1 output layer as our final model which is shown in Fig. 5. For training the model, we used batch_size = 16 with 50 epochs for each batch. The preprocessed data is divided into 70-30 train-test-split for training and validation purpose. Our model consists of 256 inputs, 3 x 3 square kernel, 3 output units and a softmax output. We used ReLU as our activation function to prevent the exponential growth of required computation and to explore the non-linear relationship between input and output variables. After each convolutional layer, input goes through the pooling layer having 2 x 2 kernel size to reduce the dimensions of the features map. Pooling layer summarizes the presented features in a region and helps to prevent the over-fitting problem by down sampling. We also used dropout layer after each pooling layer to prevent neurons in a layer from synchronously optimizing their weights and converging to the same goal. Our model’s dropout rate is 0.3, which means 30% of the neurons of this layer will be randomly dropped in each epoch.\n",

      "Why does existing knowledge enhanced PLMs (such as CokeBERT and CoLake) cannot be used directly for re-ranking tasks? \n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "Existing KE-PLMs can be categorized by the granularity of knowledge they incorporate from knowledge graph (KG), as text-based knowledge, entity knowledge and KG meta-graphs.To integrate text-based knowledge, RAG (Lewiset al., 2020) and KIF (Fanet al., 2020) first retrieve top-k documents from Wikipedia using KNN-based retrieval, and the PLM model is employed to generate the output conditioned on these retrieved documents. Entity-level information can be highly useful for a variety of natural language understanding tasks. Hence, many existing KE-PLMs target this type of simple yet powerful knowledge. ERNIE(BAIDU) (Sun et al., 2019) introduces a new pre-training strategy of language model which masking phrases or entities in order to implicitly learn both synaptic and semantic knowledge from these units. ERNIE(THU) (Zhanget al., 2019) integrates informative entity representations in the knowledge module into the underlying layers of the semantic module based on the alignments between text and entity to equip the model with the ability of knowledge awareness. As knowledge graphs provide richer information than simply entity, more and more researchers start to explore integration of more sophisticated knowledge, such as meta-graphs in KG. CokeBERT (Su et al., 2021) proposes a novel semantic-driven Graph Neural Network (GNN) to dynamically select contextual knowledge and embed knowledge context according to textual context for PLMs, which can avoid the effect of redundant and ambiguous knowledge in KGs that cannot match the input text.CoLake (Sunet al., 2020a) also uses GNN to aggregate information from the constructed meta-graph in both pre-training and inference. CoLake converts the meta-graph into token sequence and appends it to input sequence for PLMs, which is distinctive to CokeBERT. Although extensive research has been proposed up to now to address the knowledge-aware problem, none exists which constrained on how to use knowledge to empower PLMs particularly for re-ranking tasks.\n",

There is a difference between regular hair fall and alopecia; the latter develops coin-sized bald patches all over the scalp area. Alopecia or patchy hair loss can be of different types.

      "What does non-differentiable mean here? If the problem with previous metrics is that they are not per-token differentiable then why are they looking for a way to optimize non-differentiable objectives? \n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "The ultimate aim of language technology is to interact with humans.However, most language models are trained without direct signals of human preference,with supervised target strings serving as (a sometimes crude) proxy.One option to incorporate user feedback is via human-in-the-loop, i.e., a user would be expected to provide feedback for each sample online as the model trains, but this degree of dense supervision is often prohibitive and inefficient.Automated metrics offer a promising compromise: learned models of human preference like BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2019), BLEURT (Sellam et al., 2020), summarization preferences (Wu et al., 2021) have significantly improved correlation with human judgment compared to earlier metrics (BLEU, METEOR, etc.), and are cheap to evaluate. But — these functions are usually not per-token differentiable: like humans, metrics can only offer quality estimates for full generations.Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a natural path forward for optimizing non-differentiable, scalar objectives for LM-based generation when it is cast as a sequential decision-making problem. However, Goodhart’s Law222Strathern (1997) paraphrases: When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.looms: particularly in the case of imperfect metrics that use neural networks, it is easy to find nonsense samples that achieve high-quality estimates. Recent works have shown promising results in aligning LMs to human preferences via RL by constraining preference-based rewards to incorporate notions of fluency (Wu et al., 2021; Ouyang et al., 2022) but progress in this line of work is heavily hindered by a lack of open-source benchmarks and algorithmic implementations—resulting in perception that RL is a challenging paradigm for NLP (Choshen et al., 2020; Kreutzer et al., 2021).\n",

This non-differentiability is pointed out as a problem by the authors for the new metrics (i.e. things like BLUERT or BERTScore) - it is unclear from this paper alone if previous vanilla metrics (i.e. BLEU) were per token differentiable or not.

The history at time step t , h t = { o 0 , a 0 , . . . o t − 1 , a t − 1 , o t } , is a sequence of all previous observations and actions.

      "Can we use image classification models for semantic segmentation? \n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "Semantic pixel-wise segmentation is an ongoing topic of research, fuelled by challenging datasets [1, 33, 9]. Current best performing methods all mostly rely on hand engineered features generally used for per-pixel independent classification. Typically, a patch is fed into a classifier e.g. Random Forest [32, 2] or Boosting [36, 20] to predict the class probabilities of the center pixel. Features based on appearance [32], SfM and appearance [2, 36, 20] have been explored for the CamVid test. These per-pixel noisy predictions (often called unary terms) from the classifiers are then smoothed by using a pair-wise or higher order CRF [36, 20] to improve the accuracy. More recent approaches have aimed to produce high quality unaries by trying to predict the labels for all the pixels in a patch as opposed to only the center pixel. This improves the results of Random Forest based unaries [18] but thin structured classes are classfied poorly. Dense depth maps computed from the CamVid video have also been used as input for classification using Random Forests [43]. Another approach argues for the use of a combination of popular hand designed features and spatio temporal super-pixelization to obtain higher accuracy [39]. Recent top performing technique on the CamVid test [20] addresses the imbalance among label frequencies by using additional training data from the PASCAL VOC dataset to learn object detectors. The result of all these techniques indicates the need for improved classification as increases in accuracy have mostly come from adding new features or modalities to the classifier. Post-processing using CRF models of various orders [36] has mainly resulted in improving the accuracy of dominant classes such as sky, road, buildings with little effect on the accuracy of thin structured but equally important classes such as signs, poles, pedestrians. This highlights the need for better pixel-wise classification when imbalanced label frequencies exist.Meanwhile, indoor RGBD pixel-wise semantic segmentation has also gained popularity since the release of the NYU dataset [33] which showed the usefulness of the depth channel to improve segmentation. Their approach used features such as RGB-SIFT, depth-SIFT, location as input to a neural network classifier to predict pixel unaries. The noisy unaries are then smoothed using a CRF. Improvements were made using a richer feature set including LBP and region segmentation to obtain higher accuracy [28] followed by a CRF. In more recent work [33], both class segmentation and support relationships are inferred together using a combination of RGB and depth based cues. Another approach focusses on real-time joint reconstruction and semantic segmentation, where Random Forests are used as the classifier [13]. Gupta et al. [12] use boundary detection and hierarchical grouping before performing category segmentation. The common attribute along all these approaches is the use of hand engineered features for pixel-wise classifiction of either RGB or RGBD images. The application of deep learning for scene segmentation has only just begun. There have also been a few attempts to apply networks designed for categorization to segmentation, particularly by replicating the deepest layer features in blocks to match image dimensions [7, 6, 11, 8]. However, the resulting classification is blocky [11]. Another approach using recurrent neural networks [26] merges several low resolution predictions to create input image resolution predictions. On the whole, although some of these techniques already present improvements over hand engineered features [7].\n",

      "Training a task-oriented dialogue agent can be naturally formulated as ofﬂine rein- forcement learning (RL) problem, where the agent aims to learn a conversational strategy to achieve user goals, only from a dialogue corpus. It is very challenging in terms of RL since the natural language action space is astronomical, while feasi- ble (syntactically and semantically correct) actions are very sparse. Thus, standard RL methods easily fail and generate responses diverging from human language, even when ﬁne-tuning a powerful pre-trained language model. In this paper, we introduce GPT-Critic, an ofﬂine RL method for task-oriented dialogue. GPT-Critic is built upon GPT-2, ﬁne-tuning the language model through behavior cloning of the critic-guided self-generated sentences. GPT-Critic is essentially free from the issue of diverging from human language since it learns from the sentences sam- pled from the pre-trained language model. In the experiments, we demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art in the task-oriented dialogue benchmarks including MultiWOZ 2.0 and ConvLab.\n",

The costly work of collecting more labelled dataand the tedious work of doing more clever engineering can go a long way insolving particular problems, but this is ultimately unsatisfying as a machinelearning solution.

      "These gradient-based approaches are attractive in their simplicity, but the optimization process tends to produce images that do not greatly resemble natural images. Instead, they are composed of a collection of “hacks” that happen to cause high (or low) activations: extreme pixel values, structured high frequency patterns, and copies of common motifs without global structure (Simonyan et al., 2013; Nguyen et al., 2014; Szegedy et al., 2013; Goodfellow et al., 2014). The fact that activations may be effected by such hacks is better understood thanks to several recent studies. Specifically, it has been shown that such hacks may be applied to correctly classified images to cause them to be misclassified even via imperceptibly small changes (Szegedy et al., 2013), that such hacks can be found even without the gradient information to produce unrecognizable “fooling examples” (Nguyen et al., 2014), and that the abundance of non-natural looking images that cause extreme activations can be explained by the locally linear behavior of neural nets(Goodfellow et al., 2014).\n",

Our framework is however not limited to this choice, and the proposed algorithm can simply be adapted to find minimal adversarial perturbations for any \\ell_{p} norm (p\\in[1,\\infty)).

      "Much of the recent research on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has focused on increasing accuracy on computer vision datasets.For a given accuracy level, there typically exist multiple CNN architectures that achieve that accuracy level.Given equivalent accuracy, a CNN architecture with fewer parameters has several advantages:\\bulletMore efficient distributed training.Communication among servers is the limiting factor to the scalability of distributed CNN training.For distributed data-parallel training, communication overhead is directly proportional to the number of parameters in the model Iandola et al. (2016).In short, small models train faster due to requiring less communication.\\bulletLess overhead when exporting new models to clients. For autonomous driving, companies such as Tesla periodically copy new models from their servers to customers’ cars. This practice is often referred to as an over-the-air update. Consumer Reports has found that the safety of Tesla’s Autopilot semi-autonomous driving functionality has incrementally improved with recent over-the-air updates Consumer Reports (2016). However, over-the-air updates of today’s typical CNN/DNN models can require large data transfers. With AlexNet, this would require 240MB of communication from the server to the car. Smaller models require less communication, making frequent updates more feasible.\\bulletFeasible FPGA and embedded deployment.

UED (Yanet al., 2021) proposes a cascade pre-training manner that can jointly enhance the retrieval stage through passage expansion with a pre-trained query generator and thus elevate the re-ranking stage with a pre-trained transformer encoder. The two stages can facilitate each other in a unified pre-training framework. H-ERNIE (Chuet al., 2022) proposes a multi-granularity PLM for web search.(2) By designing rational distillation procedure: LM Distill + Fine-Tuning (Gaoet al., 2020) explores a variety of distillation methods to equip a smaller re-ranker with both general-purpose language modeling knowledge learned in pre-training and search- specific relevance modeling knowledge learned in fine-tuning, and produces a faster re-ranker with better ranking performance. CAKD (Hofstätter et al., 2020) proposes a cross-architecture knowledge distillation procedure with a Margin-MSE loss, which can distill knowledge from multiple teachers at the same time. RocketQAv1 (Qu et al., 2021) trains dual-encoder and cross-encoder in a cascade manner, which leverages the powerful cross-encoder to empower the dual-encoder. RocketQAv2 (Ren et al., 2021) proposes a novel approach that jointly trains the dense passage retriever and passage re-ranker. The parameters of RocketQAv2 are inherited from RocketQAv1. Besides, RocketQAv2 utilizes a large PLM for data augmentation and denoising, which can also be regarded as a distillation procedure. Notably, these two types of studies anticipate more insightful information to be captured by the advanced ranking and training procedures, while neglecting the limitations of implicit knowledge extracted from noisy and heterogeneous data.

Video interpolation typically involves sophisticated algorithms that consider multiple frames to estimate where the missing frames might be in between. This is because only two images do not provide enough data for the algorithm to accurately predict missing frames. These algorithms often use techniques such wild motion compensation, median filtering, and wavelet transforms to predict the next frame.

To manage the computational requirements of training our models, we only train on a small subset of say 16 frames at a time. However, at test time we can generate longer videos by extending our samples. For example, we could first generate a video \\mathbf{x}^{\\text{a}}\\sim p_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{x}) consisting of 16 frames, and then extend it with a second sample \\mathbf{x}^{\\text{b}}\\sim p_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{x}^{\\text{b}}|\\mathbf{x}^{\\text{a}}). If \\mathbf{x}^{\\text{b}} consists of frames following \\mathbf{x}^{\\text{a}}, this allows us to autoregressively extend our sampled videos to arbitrary lengths, which we demonstrate in Section 4.3.3.

      "What is a major drawback of deep learning approaches adapting networks designed for object categorization to pixel wise labeling? \n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "Semantic segmentation is an important step towards understanding and inferring different objects and their arrangements observed in a scene. This has wide array of applications ranging from estimating scene geometry, inferring support-relationships among objects to autonomous vehicle driving. Early methods that relied on low-level vision cues have fast been superseded by popular machine learning algorithms. In particular, deep learning has seen huge success lately in handwritten digit recognition, speech, categorising whole images and detecting objects in images [37, 34] also seen growing interest in semantic pixel-wise labelling problems [7, 14, 35]. However, these recent approaches have tried to directly adopt deep architectures designed for category prediction to pixel-wise labelling. The results, although very encouraging, have not been quite satisfactory. Primarily, the deepest layer representations/feature maps are of a small resolution as compared to input image dimensions due to several pooling layers e.g. if 2\\times 2 non-overlapping max-pooling-subsampling layers are used three times, the resulting feature map is 1/8^{th} of the input dimension. Therefore, an ad hoc technique is used to upsample the deepest layer feature map to match the input image dimensions by replicating features within a block i.e. all pixels within a block (8\\times 8 in our example) have the same features. This often results in predictions that appear blocky222see http://david.grangier.info/scene_parsing/. This is exactly what we improve using our proposed SegNet architecture, wherein the decoders learn to map the deepest layer features to full image dimensions. Learning to decode has two other advantages.First, deeper layers each with pooling-subsampling can be introduced which increases the spatial context for pixel labelling. This results in smooth predictions unlike patch based classifiers [36, 2]. Second, ablation studies to understand the effects of features such as in [41] can be performed using the decoder stack.\n",

Recent efforts on small scale language modeling have used CNN character embeddings for the input embeddings (Kim et al., 2015). Although not as straightforward, we propose an extension to this idea to also reduce the number of parameters of the Softmax layer. Recall from Section 2.3 that the Softmax computes a logit as z_{w}=h^{T}e_{w} where h is a context vector and e_{w} the word embedding. Instead of building a matrix of |V|\\times|h| (whose rows correspond to e_{w}), we produce e_{w} with a CNN over the characters of w as e_{w}=CNN(chars_{w}) – we call this a CNN Softmax. We used the same network architecture to dynamically generate the Softmax word embeddings without sharing the parameters with the input word-embedding sub-network. For inference, the vectors e_{w} can be precomputed, so there is no computational complexity increase w.r.t. the regular Softmax.\n",

      "Matching networks Vinyals et al. (2016) use a set representation for the ensemble of images in \\mathcal{T},similarly as our proposed graph neural network model, but with two important differences.First, the attention mechanism considered in this set representationis akin to the edge feature learning, with the difference that the mechanism attends always to the same node embeddings, as opposed to our stacked adjacency learning, which is closer to Vaswani et al. (2017). In other words, instead of the attention kernel in (3),matching networks consider attention mechanisms of the form \\tilde{A}_{*,j}^{(k)}=\\varphi({\\bf x}_{*}^{(k)},{\\bf x}_{j}^{(T)}),where {\\bf x}_{j}^{(T)} is the encoding function for the elements of the support set, obtained with bidirectional LSTMs. In that case, the support set encoding is thus computed independently of the target image.Second, the label and image fields are treated separately throughout the model, with a final step that aggregates linearly the labels using a trained kernel. This may prevent the model to leverage complex dependencies between labels and images at intermediate stages.\n",

      "The ability to understand natural language through commonsense reasoning is one of the core focuses in the field of natural language processing. To measure and study the different aspects of commonsense reasoning, several datasets are developed, such as SocialIQA (Sap et al., 2019b), CommonsenseQA (Talmor et al., 2018), and PhysicalIQA (Bisk et al., 2020), each requiring different type of commonsense knowledge (e.g., social, taxonomic, causal, declarative, etc) to select the correct answer. While large-scale neural systems (Devlin et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019b) have shown human-level accuracy on these benchmarks, recent studies (Mitra et al., 2019) also criticize that these models solve individual datasets, rather than learning how to perform general semantic reasoning.

      "In order to understand the effectiveness of MC-LAVE as a policy improvement operator, we compare the performances of PUCT-RL and MC-LAVE-RL in Z ORK 1. Table 2 reports the intermediate results of planning and supervised learning in each iteration of the policy iteration. In each iteration, the policy and the Q-function are trained using planning trajectories and experience replay collected from 25 independent planning agents. As can be seen in Table 2, the performance of MC-LAVE-RL is improved more consistently than PUCT-RL, both in planning and learning. At the beginning of the policy iteration, PUCT-RL improves the performance, but it fails to overcome bottleneck and converges to a suboptimal policy: PUCT utilizes the prior policy learned by imitating the planning results of the previous iteration to estimate the exploration bonus, but this uncertainty-based method is not much effective to encourage the agent to explore the action space that is not sufﬁciently covered. On the other hand, MC-LAVE-RL not only uses the prior policy, but also uses Q-Network for credit assignment to language actions. This allows a more focused exploration on semantically promising actions and consequently overcomes the bottleneck to further improve the performance.\n",

      "In the context of VLAD (Vector of Lengths ADditive), the output matrix is typically normalized to improve the performance of the classifier. One common normalization method used by authors is **L2 normalization**.

This ensures that the resulting vector has a length of 1, simplifying certain operations and helping to maintain a consistent scale across different inputs.

Bruna et al. (2013); Henaff et al. (2015) proposed to learn smooth spectral multipliers of the graph Laplacian, albeit with high computational cost, and Defferrard et al.

In particular, Kipf & Welling (2016)was the first to propose the use of GNNs on semi-supervised classification problems.We refer the reader to Bronstein et al. (2017) for an exhaustive literature review on the topic.GNNs and the analogous Neural Message Passing Models are finding application in many different domains. Battaglia et al. (2016); Chang et al.

To this end, we mimic human judgment and only focus on the sentence of each passage that is the most related to a query (Zou et al., 2021).In particular, we define the relevance score between a query q and a sentence \\textbf{s}_{i} as(7)Rel_{qs}(\\textbf{q},\\textbf{s}_{i})=\\frac{\\sum_{q=1}^{|\\textbf{q}|}\\textbf{E}(w_{q})}{|\\textbf{q}|}\\cdot\\frac{\\sum_{s=1}^{|\\textbf{s}_{i}|}\\textbf{E}(w_{s})}{|\\textbf{s}_{i}|}.For the sake of efficiency, we initialize \\textbf{E}(w) from Word2Vec (Mikolovet al., 2013) embedding.Based on Eq.(7), we select the most relevant sentence \\textbf{s}^{*} in p to build the meta-graph for \\mathbf{q} and \\mathbf{p}.(2)Target entity recognition.Next, we select the entities in q and \\textbf{s}^{*} to construct the meta-graph. Specifically, we only consider the entities that exactly match in \\mathcal{E}. Meanwhile, we omit those entity phrases that are sub-sequences of other recognized entities.For example, in the query \"what causes low liver enzymes\", both \"liver\" and \"liver enzyme\" are entities, but the entity \"liver enzyme\" is more informative to be recognized as the target entity, and \"liver\" should be omitted.(3)Path discovery. Finally, given the target entities of q and \\textbf{s}^{*} (denoted as \\phi_{\\mathbf{q}} and \\phi_{\\mathbf{s}^{*}}, respectively), we perform Breadth First Search (BFS) on \\overline{\\mathcal{G}} to discover the paths within K-hop between \\phi_{\\mathbf{q}} and \\phi_{\\mathbf{s}^{*}}. Note that we only keep the within-K-hop paths that might be the most useful for the downstream re-ranking task. Meanwhile, the knowledge could be complemented from the K-hop paths.\n",

      "#### Entities that exactly match entities in E are selected from q and s* to construct the meta-graph. Also, entities that are sub-sequences of other recognized entities are omitted.

(2012), simulated annealing Ludermir et al. (2006), randomized search Bergstra & Bengio (2012), and genetic algorithms Stanley & Miikkulainen (2002).To their credit, each of these papers provides a case in which the proposed DSE approach produces a NN architecture that achieves higher accuracy compared to a representative baseline.However, these papers make no attempt to provide intuition about the shape of the NN design space.Later in this paper, we eschew automated approaches – instead, we refactor CNNs in such a way that we can do principled A/B comparisons to investigate how CNN architectural decisions influence model size and accuracy.\n",

      "Can image content and style be \"fully\" or \"completely\" separated? \n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "Again, we can visualise the information captured by these style feature spaces built on different layers of the network by constructing an image that matches the style representation of a given input image (Fig 1, style reconstructions). 10,11 Indeed reconstructions from the style features produce texturised versions of the input image that capture its general appearance in terms of colour and localised structures. Moreover, the size and complexity of local image structures from the input image increases along the hierarchy, a result that can be explained by the increasing receptive ﬁeld sizes and feature complexity. We refer to this multi-scale representation as style representation . The key ﬁnding of this paper is that the representations of content and style in the Convo- lutional Neural Network are separable. That is, we can manipulate both representations inde- pendently to produce new, perceptually meaningful images. To demonstrate this ﬁnding, we generate images that mix the content and style representation from two different source images. In particular, we match the content representation of a photograph depicting the “Neckarfront” in T ¨ ubingen, Germany and the style representations of several well-known artworks taken from different periods of art (Fig 2). The images are synthesised by ﬁnding an image that simultaneously matches the content representation of the photograph and the style representation of the respective piece of art (see Methods for details). While the global arrangement of the original photograph is preserved, the colours and local structures that compose the global scenery are provided by the artwork. Effectively, this renders the photograph in the style of the artwork, such that the appearance of the synthesised image resembles the work of art, even though it shows the same content as the photograph. As outlined above, the style representation is a multi-scale representation that includes mul- tiple layers of the neural network. In the images we have shown in Fig 2, the style representation\n",
      "\n",
      "#### The paper suggests that it is impossible to completely separate the content and the style of the image. But it is possible to extract their representations to then combine them with a loss function that allows the generation of visually appealing images that somewhat satisfy (not fully) the content and stylistic constraints. It is important to mention that the artistic style representation is just a correlation of filter responses between layers in CNN. The paper suggests that this is a plausible way to obtain the content-independent visual appearance of the image. When the object recognition model is learning, it has to be able to extract features that are invariant to different variations of images. Thus, it allows the separation of content and style representations. Previous methods use non-parametric techniques that directly manipulate the pixels of the image without such separation of representations. \n",

      "Answer:\n",
      "The class of Deep Neural Networks that are most powerful in image processing tasks are called Convolutional Neural Networks. Convolutional Neural Networks consist of layers of small computational units that process visual information hierarchically in a feed-forward man- ner (Fig 1). Each layer of units can be understood as a collection of image ﬁlters, each of which extracts a certain feature from the input image. Thus, the output of a given layer consists of so-called feature maps: differently ﬁltered versions of the input image. When Convolutional Neural Networks are trained on object recognition, they develop a representation of the image that makes object information increasingly explicit along the pro- cessing hierarchy. 8 Therefore, along the processing hierarchy of the network, the input image is transformed into representations that increasingly care about the actual content of the im- age compared to its detailed pixel values. We can directly visualise the information each layer contains about the input image by reconstructing the image only from the feature maps in that layer 9 (Fig 1, content reconstructions, see Methods for details on how to reconstruct the im- age). Higher layers in the network capture the high-level content in terms of objects and their arrangement in the input image but do not constrain the exact pixel values of the reconstruc- tion. (Fig 1, content reconstructions d,e). In contrast, reconstructions from the lower layers simply reproduce the exact pixel values of the original image (Fig 1, content reconstructions a,b,c). We therefore refer to the feature responses in higher layers of the network as the content representation . To obtain a representation of the style of an input image, we use a feature space originally designed to capture texture information. 8 This feature space is built on top of the ﬁlter responses in each layer of the network. It consists of the correlations between the different ﬁlter responses\n",

      "#### The content representation of the photograph resembles the pixel-wise image more in the lower layers, but encodes the more high-level contents in the higher layers. To construct the results in Figure 2, the authors use the content representation from one of the highest layers 'conv_4_2', which means they fuse well with the extracted style representations. Also, it is possible to change the emphasis between the content representation and style representation using the loss function. In general, the results of combining lower-layer content representations with styles are not presented, thus it is difficult to answer the question just from the paper's contents. \n",
